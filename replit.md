# ReferralLink - Job Referral Marketplace Platform

## Overview

ReferralLink is a comprehensive job referral marketplace that connects job seekers with employees and HR professionals. The platform facilitates job referrals by allowing company employees to post opportunities, candidates to apply through referrals, and HR teams to manage their company's referral pipeline. The application is built as a full-stack web platform with a vanilla JavaScript frontend and Express.js backend.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Technology preference: Plain JavaScript (no React, no TypeScript - user finds TypeScript confusing)
Styling preference: Bootstrap for UI components and responsive design

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (no React or TypeScript)
- **UI Library**: Bootstrap 5 with Font Awesome icons
- **Styling**: CSS3 with custom variables and Bootstrap responsive classes
- **State Management**: Native JavaScript with localStorage for authentication
- **Routing**: Custom client-side routing system
- **Form Handling**: Native HTML forms with JavaScript validation
- **Build Tool**: Direct file serving (no build process required)

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling resume uploads (PDF/Word documents)
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage

### Development Setup
- **Simple Structure**: Public directory with static files, server directory with API
- **Module System**: ES Modules for server, vanilla JavaScript for frontend
- **Development Server**: Express server serving static files and API
- **Hot Reload**: Manual browser refresh (no complex build process)

## Key Components

### User Roles and Authentication
- **Three User Types**: Candidates (job seekers), Referrers (employees), and HR (company admins)
- **Role-Based Access**: Different dashboard views and permissions based on user role
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT tokens with password hashing and validation

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Core user information with role and company association
- **Profiles Table**: Extended user profile data including skills, experience, and resume
- **Companies Table**: Company information and metadata
- **Jobs Table**: Job postings with referrer association and status tracking
- **Applications Table**: Job application tracking with status management

### UI Components
- **Design System**: Comprehensive component library using Radix UI primitives
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap-inspired layout classes
- **Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant components with keyboard navigation support
- **Theme Support**: CSS custom properties for light/dark theme switching

### API Structure
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Organized by resource (auth, users, jobs, applications, companies)
- **Middleware**: Authentication middleware for protected routes
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **File Upload**: Secure file handling with type and size validation

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up with email/password and role selection
2. Password is hashed using bcrypt before storage
3. JWT token is generated upon successful login
4. Token is stored in localStorage and sent with API requests
5. Server validates JWT tokens using middleware for protected routes

### Job Application Flow
1. Referrer posts job opportunity with company association
2. Job appears in candidate job search/feed
3. Candidate applies through application modal with optional message
4. Application is stored with tracking status
5. Referrer and HR can view applications in their respective dashboards

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Relational data with foreign key constraints
- **File Storage**: Resume files stored in uploads directory
- **Session Storage**: JWT tokens for authentication state
- **Query Caching**: TanStack Query handles client-side caching and synchronization

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/**: Complete set of unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing
- **zod**: TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation

### Backend Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Neon database driver for serverless PostgreSQL
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM with excellent TypeScript support
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing and validation
- **jsonwebtoken**: JWT token generation and verification
- **multer**: File upload handling middleware

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **typescript**: Type checking and compilation
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js development
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production builds

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL for development
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET required
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for frontend, tsx watch mode for backend

### Production Build
- **Frontend Build**: Vite builds optimized static assets to dist/public
- **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code to dist/index.js
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets in production
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit handles schema migrations

### Hosting Requirements
- **Node.js Runtime**: ES Modules support required
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Compatible with Neon or any PostgreSQL provider
- **File Storage**: Local file system for resume uploads (uploads/ directory)
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET must be configured

The application is designed to be platform-agnostic and can be deployed to any Node.js hosting service that supports ES Modules and PostgreSQL connectivity.
